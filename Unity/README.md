# Unity

Here lives the Unity C# API for Misty. 

## Info
>It is my reccomendation to use Unity Hub an just have diff  
versions of Unity installed if you run in compatibilty issues.  
I will attempt to keep things updated as the API for Misty changes  
on the robot.

**Currently tested versions of Unity:**  
* 2018.x

### API Explorer
>you can either open the project in unity OR you can download the binary from the release page

### Simulator
>A way to play with a very basic _virtual_ version of Misty, 
>or use to test skills in JS if you don't have the physical robot yet.
>Also feel free to use or modify the source or look at releases for the binary
